IPLC or CM19A Linux Installation

For 2.6 and 3.0 kernel users
--------------------
Go to the driver directory. To build the device driver, execute
 make in the driver directory as root:

	% make

The device module, labjack.ko, should be built.  Once the device driver 
is built, you can use insmod to load the device.  As root, execute:

	# insmod iplc.ko

You should see a message on the console (use dmesg to view the messages if
 you are in X).

If /dev/usb/iplc0 is not created automatically, then you must create 
the device node with the following command executed as root:

	# mkdir /dev/usb
	# mknod --mode=a=rw /dev/usb/iplc0 c 180 240

(NOTE: you only need to make the device node once.)

I've not needed the do the following under Linux 2.6 (Gentoo) though I
don't have the hid module loaded.

HID NOTE: If the hid module is loaded (use lsmod to view the modules and 
look for "hid"), the provided labjack driver will not work correctly.  
Since the Labjack is classified as a HID device, the hid driver will claim 
the device.  However, the hid driver does not support the "Interrupt" out 
endpoint used by the Labjack and thus cannot communicate with the Labjack.  
You must remove the hid driver prior to loading the labjack driver.  The 
following command, as root, should suffice:

	# modprobe -r hid

If you absolutely must have the hid device driver loaded, it is possible to
add the Labjack to the HID blacklist.  Add the Labjack USB vendor (0x0cd5) 
and product (0x0001) IDs to the hid_blacklist structure in hid-core.c in 
the drivers/usb/input directory.  An example of the line to insert in the 
hid_blacklist structure would be:

For plinc:
(0x10bf, 0x0001, HID_QUIRK_IGNORE}

For iplc:
(0x10bf, 0x0004, HID_QUIRK_IGNORE}

For the CM15A:
(0xbc7, 0x0001, HID_QUIRK_IGNORE}

For the CM19A:
(0x0bc7, 0x0002, HID_QUIRK_IGNORE}

For the Labjack U12:
(0x0cd5, 0x0002, HID_QUIRK_IGNORE}

For the changes to take effect, a kernel rebuild is necessary.
 
Good Luck.
