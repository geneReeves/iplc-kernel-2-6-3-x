Currently the package contains these components:

	o) Insteon PLC device drivers for the Linux Kernel v2.6 and 3.x.

Installation instructions are provided in the INSTALL file.

The cm15a driver is heavily (about 95% code reuse) based upon the
device driver for the Labjack & LegoUSB tower.  The LegoUSB tower, the
Labjack U12, and several other devices (CM19A) all use Interrupt
endpoints (both In and Out) to communicate over the USB bus.  The
device driver simply maps the two endpoints to the read() and write()
system calls.

Tested with success on sheevaplug (plug computer based on SoC arm).
